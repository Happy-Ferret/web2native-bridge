###The Proxy
This project holds a Web2Native Bridge "proxy" that must be installed
in the native platform.

The proxy is the component that makes it possible breaking away from
Native Messaging's single application model.

The proxy would be a part of a "genuine" implementation as well. It would
typically be a part of the operating system.
