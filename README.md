# Web2Native Bridge - Emulator
This repository contains all code for building and testing an emulation of
the Web2Native Bridge concept on the Chrome (desktop) browser.  It exploits
Chrome's native messaging and a single universal Chrome extension.

The called applications must be written in Java and stored in a specific
directory.  This ensures that you will not be subjected to unwanted
surprises if somebody succeeds making you navigate to a malicious page.
